    I started climbing during my freshman year of college. 
    There was a mini indoor rock gym at my school, Rutgers University, 
    and I had always taken interest in it. During the first week of school,
    the Rutgers Rock Climbing Club was having an Intro Meeting,
     where anyone could sign up and join the club. Aside from just the club,
     there was a competetive team within the club, called "Comp Team". 
     To be able to join the Competetive Climbing Team, one needed to try out and
     qualify on the day of try-outs based on skill, strength, and performance.

     If you're new to the sport of climbing, I think it would be important to 
     inform you on the different levels or "grades" of the climbing routes. 
     Each route is given a specific grade that is based on the level of difficulty of the climb. 
     Shown below is a list of grades that go by the "V-Scale", which is most commonly used in the States 
     for a discipline of climbing called bouldering. Bouldering is essentially a form of 
     free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of 
     ropes or harnesses.

    One of my favorite indoor climbing gyms in the Salt Lake City area are the Momentum Gyms. (They're even having a 2 week free trial at the moment!) Click the button below to sign up to climb!

    Otherwise, there are so many places I love to climb outdoors all over the country! Some of these places include Bishop, CA, Red River Gorge, KY, Joe's Valley, UT, and American Fork, UT!
